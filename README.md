Module 3: Strategic Labeling & Advanced Filtering Techniques (60-90 mins) (Focus: Using labels for automation triggers, complex state management, and powerful reporting)

Objective: Implement advanced labeling strategies for workflow automation, multi-faceted categorization, and precise data retrieval.
Topics:
Scoped Labels Mastery:
Designing effective scoped label systems (e.g., Workflow::, Priority::, Team::, QA::Status).
Enforcing workflow progression using scoped labels on Issue Boards.
Group Labels vs. Project Labels: Strategic decisions for consistency vs. specificity. Promoting project labels to group labels.
Labels for Automation:
Using labels to trigger CI/CD jobs (e.g., a deploy::staging label).

Module 4: Work Hierarchies: Epics vs. Milestones vs. Issues/Tasks (60-75 mins)

Objective: Clearly differentiate and strategically utilize Epics, Milestones, and Issues (including task lists) for effective short-term and long-term planning.
Topics:
Epics (Strategic Themes - Primarily Premium/Ultimate):
Purpose: Grouping issues and child-epics under large initiatives or features.
Characteristics: Start/end dates (fixed or inherited), multi-level hierarchy.
Use Cases: Product roadmapping, tracking major deliverables, cross-project initiatives.
Issues (Work Items/Tasks):
Purpose: The fundamental unit of work (story, bug, task).
Task Lists within Issues (Sub-tasks): For breaking down an issue into smaller, manageable steps without creating separate formal issues. When to use this vs. separate issues.
Milestones (Time-Boxes):
Purpose: Grouping issues (and indirectly, parts of epics) into time-bound periods.
Characteristics: Start/end dates, focused on delivery cadence.
Use Cases: Sprints, iterations, release versions, phases.
Key Distinctions & Relationships:
Epic = What (the initiative), Milestone = When (the timebox), Issue = How (the specific work).
How they interact: An Epic can span multiple Milestones; a Milestone can contain Issues from multiple Epics.
Visualizing: Epics on Roadmaps, Issues in Milestones & Boards.
Activities:
Scenario-based discussion: Given a large project, map out potential Epics, child Issues, and how Milestones would apply.
Analyze how task lists within an issue could be used vs. creating separate child issues for an Epic.
If Epics are available: Create a multi-level epic structure and assign issues. View on a roadmap.
Module 5: Advanced Git Branching Workflows: Rebase vs. Merge with GitLab (60-90 mins)

Objective: Understand the implications of rebasing versus merging in Git, and how to apply these strategies effectively within a GitLab Merge Request workflow.
Topics:
Core Concepts Review:
What is git merge? (Preserves history, creates merge commits).
What is git rebase? (Rewrites history, creates a linear history).
Pros and Cons:
Merge: Traceability, explicit integration points vs. cluttered history.
Rebase: Cleaner, linear history vs. risk of rewriting shared history, potential for more complex conflict resolution (if done late).
Strategic Application:
When to Rebase: Typically on local feature branches before pushing or to update a feature branch with changes from the target branch (e.g., main).
When to Merge: Integrating main into a long-lived feature branch (to avoid constant rebasing), or as the final step of integrating a feature branch via a Merge Request if that's the chosen project strategy.
GitLab Merge Request (MR) Settings & Strategies:
Merge Commit (default).
Merge commit with semi-linear history (encourages rebase before merge).
Fast-forward merge (only if feature branch is directly ahead of target).
Squash and merge (combines all feature branch commits into one on the target branch).
Team workflows: Feature branching, Gitflow (and how rebase/merge fit).
Interactive Rebase (git rebase -i): Squashing, rewording, reordering commits on a feature branch before creating an MR or pushing for review.
Handling Merge Conflicts during Rebase vs. Merge.
Caution: Never rebase a branch that others are using and pulling from.
Activities:
Live demo/walkthrough:
Rebasing a feature branch onto main.
Merging main into a feature branch.
Resolving a simple conflict in both scenarios.
Review GitLab project settings for MRs and discuss implications of different merge methods.
Team discussion on establishing a consistent branching and merging strategy.
Module 6: Advanced Issue Board Configurations & Automation (45-60 mins)

Quick board actions: Creating issues directly in columns.
Activities:
Configure a board with WIP limits.
If available, set up swimlanes by Epic on a board.
Design a board specifically for a "Sprint Retrospective" or "Bug Triage" process.
Module 7: GitLab CI/CD Foundations (Refresher/Intro for Context) (30-45 mins)

Module 8: CI/CD Pipeline Best Practices & Dynamic Test Execution (90-120 mins)

Objective: Implement CI/CD best practices for efficiency, maintainability, and security, including how to structure tests to run conditionally.
Topics:
CI/CD Best Practices:
Optimize for Speed: Small, fast jobs; parallelization (parallel: keyword); efficient Docker image usage.
Effective Caching: Dependencies, build outputs.
Secure Secrets Management: Using CI/CD variables (protected, masked), integration with HashiCorp Vault (Premium/Ultimate).
DRY Pipelines: include: for templates/common configurations, YAML anchors/aliases (&, *, <<).
Idempotent Jobs: Ensuring jobs can be re-run without negative side effects.
Review Apps: Dynamically creating environments for MRs.
Managing Pipeline Costs/Resources (especially with shared runners).
Structuring Pipeline Tests to Run "As Needs" Basis:
rules: Keyword: The modern and most flexible way.
rules:if: with CI/CD variables (predefined or custom).
rules:changes: Run jobs only if specific files/paths change (e.g., run backend tests if backend code changes).
rules:exists: Run jobs if specific files exist.
rules:when: manual for optional jobs (e.g., deployment to production).
rules:allow_failure: for non-critical jobs.
only/except (legacy but still encountered): Basic conditional execution based on branches, tags, variables, changes.
Using Variables to Control Job Execution: Setting variables in one job to be used in rules:if: of subsequent jobs.
Parent-Child Pipelines & Dynamic Pipelines: For complex scenarios where pipeline structure is determined at runtime.
Activities:
Analyze an existing .gitlab-ci.yml (or a provided example) for areas of improvement based on best practices.
Modify a CI job to run only when files in a specific directory (/backend) are changed using rules:changes:.
Create a manual job for deployment using rules:when: manual.
Discuss strategies for running different test suites (unit, integration, E2E) based on triggers (e.g., MR vs. main branch, specific code changes).
